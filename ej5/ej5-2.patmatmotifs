# * EGF-like domain signatures and profile *
# ******************************************
# 
# A sequence of  about thirty  to forty amino-acid  residues  long found in  the
# sequence of  epidermal  growth  factor  (EGF)  has been  shown  [1 to 6] to be
# present, in  a more or less conserved form, in a large number of other, mostly
# animal  proteins.  EGF  is  a  polypeptide  of about 50 amino acids with three
# internal  disulfide  bridges.  It  first  binds with high affinity to specific
# cell-surface receptors and then induces their dimerization, which is essential
# for  activating  the  tyrosine  kinase  in  the  receptor  cytoplasmic domain,
# initiating  a  signal  transduction  that  results  in  DNA synthesis and cell
# proliferation.
# 
# A  common  feature  of  all  EGF-like  domains  is  that they are found in the
# extracellular  domain  of  membrane-bound  proteins or in proteins known to be
# secreted (exception: prostaglandin G/H synthase). The EGF-like domain includes
# six cysteine residues which have been shown to be involved in disulfide bonds.
# The  structure  of several EGF-like domains has been solved. The fold consists
# of   two-stranded  beta-sheet  followed  by  a  loop  to  a  C-terminal  short
# two-stranded sheet   (see   <PDB:1EGF>).   Subdomains  between  the  conserved
# cysteines strongly  vary  in  length  as  shown  in  the  following  schematic
# representation of the EGF-like domain:
#

# 
# Ferredoxins  are small, acidic, electron transfer proteins that are ubiquitous
# in  biological  redox  systems.  They  have  either  4Fe-4S, 3Fe-4S, or 2Fe-2S
# cluster.  Among  them,  ferredoxin  with  one  2Fe-2S cluster per molecule are
# present  in  plants, animals, and bacteria, and form a distinct 2Fe-Ferredoxin
# family  [1,2].  They  are proteins of around one hundred amino acids with four
# conserved  cysteine  residues  to  which  the  2Fe-2S cluster is ligated. This
# conserved region is also found as a domain in various metabolic enzymes.
# 
# Several  structures  of the 2Fe-2S ferredoxin domain have been determined (see
# for example <PDB:4FXC>) [3]. The domain is classified as a beta-grasp which is
# characterized  as  having  a beta-sheet comprised of four beta-strands and one
# alpha-helix  flanking  the  sheet  [4].  The  two  Fe  atoms  are  coordinated
# tetrahedrally by the two inorganic S atoms and four cysteinyl S atoms.
# 
# Some proteins that contains a 2Fe-2S ferredoxin-type domain are listed below:
# 
#  - Ferredoxin from photosynthetic organisms;  namely plants and algae where it
#    is located in the chloroplast or cyanelle; and cyanobacteria.
#  - Ferredoxin from archaebacteria of the Halobacterium genus.
#  - Ferredoxin IV (gene pftA) and V (gene fdxD) from Rhodobacter capsulatus.

#    (gene tmoF), the toluate 1,2-dioxygenase system (gene xylZ), and the xylene
#    monooxygenase system (gene xylA) from Pseudomonas.
#  - The N-terminal domain of  phenol  hydroxylase  protein  p5 (gene dmpP) from

# Tubulins [1,2], the major  constituent of  microtubules  are dimeric  proteins

# Integrins [1,2] are a large family of cell surface receptors that mediate cell
# to cell as well as cell to matrix adhesion. Some integrins recognize the R-G-D
# sequence in their extracellular matrix protein ligand. Structurally, integrins
# consist of a dimer of an alpha and a beta chain.  Each  subunit  has  a  large
# N-terminal extracellular domain followed by a transmembrane domain and a short
# C-terminal cytoplasmic  region. Some receptors share a common beta chain while
# having different  alpha chains.  The  sequence  of  a number of different beta
# chains has been determined and are listed below:
# 
#  - Integrin beta-1, which  associates with alpha-1 to form a laminin receptor,
#    with alpha-2 to form a  collagen receptor, with  alpha-4  to  interact with
#    VCAM-1, with alpha-5 to form a fibronectin receptor, and with alpha-8.
#  - Integrin beta-2, which  associates with alpha-L (LFA-1)  to  interact  with
#    ICAM-1, and with alpha-M (MAC-1) or alpha-X  (p150,95) to form the receptor
#    for the iC3b fragment of the third complement component.
#  - Integrin beta-3, which associates with alpha-IIB  to  form  a  receptor for
#    fibrinogen,  fibronectin,  vitronectin and VWF, and with alpha-V  to form a
#    vitronectin receptor.
#  - Integrin beta-4, which associates with alpha-6.
#  - Integrin beta-5, which associates with alpha-V.
#  - Integrin beta-6 [3].
#  - Integrin beta-7 [4].
#  - Integrin beta-8, which associates with alpha-V [5].
#  - The Drosophila myospheroid protein, a probable integrin beta chain.
# 
# All the integrin beta chains contain four repeats of a forty amino acid region
# in the C-terminal extremity of their extracellular domain. Each of the repeats
# contains eight  cysteines.   We have developed a pattern from a section of the

# The structures  of  transforming  growth  factor-beta (TGF-beta), nerve growth

# Functional diverse modular proteins share a conserved domain of about 90 amino
# acids in  their  C-terminal cysteine-rich region, that has been proposed [4,5]
# to be  structurally  related  to  the  cystine-knot  family  [3]  and which is
# therefore called  C-terminal  cystine-knot  (CTCK).  Members of the C-terminal
# cystine knot family are listed below:
# 
#  - von Willebrand factor (vWF), a multifunctional protein which is involved in
#    maintaining homeostasis.  It consists of 4 vWF type D domains, 3 vWF type A
#    domains, 3  vWF  type  B  domains, 2 vWF type C domains (see <PDOC00928>, a
#    X domain and the C-terminal cystine knot.
#  - Mucins.  Human  mucin  2, a highly polymorphic multidomain molecule with  a
#    modular architecture  similar  to  vWF.  Xenopus mucin B.1 which contains a
#    CCP domain, a vWF type C domain, a X domain and a CTCK. Other  mucins  that
#    contain a  CTCK  are  the  human tracheobronchial mucin (gene MUC5), bovine
#    submaxillary mucin-like protein, pig apomucin and rat intestinal mucin-like
#    protein.
#  - CCN  family  (cef-10/cyr61/CTFG/fisp-12/nov  protein family). These growth-
#    factor inducible   proteins  are  structurally  related to the insulin-like
#    growth factor binding proteins (see <PDOC00194>) and could also function as
#    growth-factor binding proteins.
#  - Drosophila slit protein which is essential for  development of midline glia
#    and commissural axon pathways. It is composed of four leucine-rich repeats,
#    seven EGF-like domains, a laminin G-like repeat and the CTCK.
#  - Norrie disease protein (NDP) which may be involved in neuroectodermal cell-
#    cell interaction   and   in   a   pathway   that   regulates   neural  cell
#    differentiation and proliferation.
#  - Silk  moth hemocytin, an humoral lectin which is involved in a self-defence
#    mechanism. It  is  composed  of 2 FA58C domains (see <PDOC00988>), a C-type
#    lectin domain  (see  <PDOC00537>),  2  VWFC domains (see <PDOC00928), and a
#    CTCK.
# 
# The pattern  we  developed  for  CTCK correspond to the C-terminal half of the
# domain.

# * VWFC domain signature and profile *
# *************************************
# 
# The VWFC  domain  is named after the von Willebrand factor (VWF) type C repeat
# which is  found  twice  in  this multidomain protein [1,2]. It has a length of
# about 70  amino acids covering 10 well conserved cysteines. Proteins with such
# a domain [1-4] are listed below.
# 
#  - Human  von Willebrand factor  (VWF),  a multifunctional protein involved in
#    maintaining homeostasis.  It consists of 4 VWFD domains,  3 VWFA domains, 3
#    VWFB domains, 3 VWFC domains, an X domain and a C-terminal cystine knot [2].
#  - Silk  moth hemocytin, an humoral lectin which is involved in a self-defence
#    mechanism. It  is  composed  of 2 FA58C domains (see <PDOC00988>), a C-type
#    lectin domain   (see   <PDOC00537>),  2  VWFC  domains,  and  a  CTCK  (see
#    <PDOC00912>).
#  - Several  vertebrate heavily glycosylated  mucins. Human mucin 2 is secreted
#    by the  epithelia  of  different  mucus membrane-containing organs. It is a
#    highly polymorphic  multidomain molecule. Rat intestinal mucin-like peptide
#    coats the  epithelia  of  the  intestines.  Both  proteins  share a modular
#    architecture similar  to  VWF. Xenopus mucin B.1 contains a Sushi domain, a
#    VWFC domain,  a  X  domain and a C-terminal cystine knot. Other mucins that
#    contain the  VWFC  domain  are  human tracheobronchial mucin (MUC5), bovine
#    submaxillary mucin-like protein, human and pig apomucin.
#  - Cef-10/cyr61/CTGF/fisp-12/nov  protein  family.  The members of this family
#    are structurally  related  to   insulin-like growth factor binding proteins
#    (see <PDOC00194>) and could  function  as  growth  factor-binding proteins.
#    They contain an insulin-like growth factor-binding domain, a VWFC repeat, a
#    thrombospondin type 1 repeat (Tsp1) and a C-terminal cystine knot.
#  - Vertebrate  thrombospondins  1  and 2. These adhesive glycoproteins mediate
#    cell-to-cell and cell-to-matrix interactions. They are composed of a common
#    thrombospondin N-terminal  domain  (TspN),  a VWFC domain, three Tsp type 1
#    repeats (Tsp1), 3 to 4 EGF-like domains and 7 calcium-binding Tsp3 repeats.
#  - Vertebrate propeptides of fibrillar collagens alpha 1(I, II & III) and 2(V)
#    chains that  contain  an  N-terminal  VWFC  domain, a collagenous region of
#    about 1000  amino  acids  and  a  C-terminus  common to fibrillar collagens
#    (COLFI domain).
#  - Vertebrate  integral  membrane  protein  DGCR2/IDD,  a  potential  adhesion
#    receptor with  1  LDL-receptor  class  A domain (see <PDOC00929>), a C-type
#    lectin and a VWFC domain.
#  - Chordin, a Xenopus developmental protein that contains four VWFC domains.
# 
# Of these proteins, the best characterized one is the von Willebrand factor for
# which the duplicated VWFC domain is thought to participate in oligomerization,
# but not in  the initial dimerization step [4].  The presence of this region in
# other  complex-forming  proteins leads to the assumption  that the VWFC domain
# might be involved in forming larger protein complexes [1,2].
# 
# The profile we developed covers the entire VWFC domain.
